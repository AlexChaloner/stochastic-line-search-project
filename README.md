# Accelerated Stochastic Gradient Descent using Armijo Line Search



## About

A small investigation on the stochastic line search with momentum presented in the [original paper][sls_paper]. The momentum calculations were not the main focus of the paper and introduced as a quick comparison - we offer an algorithm more rigorously combining Armijo Line Search and the Nesterov and Polyak momentum methods.

Original code can be found [here][sls_code].
This project and paper are unpolished.
