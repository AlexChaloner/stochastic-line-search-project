# Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum using Armijo Line Search

## DISCLAIMER

I am not the writer of the original SLS code.
This project and paper were completed in three weeks. It is unpolished and not peer reviewed. I have no affiliation with the authors of the [original paper](sls_paper).

## About

An investigation on the stochastic line search with momentum presented in the [original paper](sls_paper). The momentum calculations were not the main focus of the paper and introduced as a quick comparison - we offer an algorithm more rigorously combining Armijo Line Search and the Nesterov and Polyak momentum methods.
