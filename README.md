# Accelerated Stochastic Gradient Descent using Armijo Line Search

## Disclaimer

I am not the writer of the main codebase -- I only appended the optimisers for the momentum algorithms.
This project and paper were completed in three weeks. It is unpolished and not peer reviewed. I have no affiliation with the authors of the [original paper][sls_paper].

## About

An investigation on the stochastic line search with momentum presented in the [original paper][sls_paper]. The momentum calculations were not the main focus of the paper and introduced as a quick comparison - we offer an algorithm more rigorously combining Armijo Line Search and the Nesterov and Polyak momentum methods.
